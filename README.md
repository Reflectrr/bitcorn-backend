# Bitcorn-backend
This is the server-side of the Bitcorn project. It is basically a Flask server in Python that serves to fetch daily bitcoin price from Polygon.io as well as providing the next close's prediction for Bitcoin. It also has a few scripts for different functionalities, such as filtering the bitcoin data, loading the trained machine model, etc.

For more information about this project, please visit the [bitcorn-frontend](https://github.com/reflectrr/bitcorn-frontend/) repo. Thanks!

I'd like to say "thank you" to my friend Samuel Jin for experimenting with the bitcoin data and coming up with a reasonably working machine learning model, as well as for coming up with this creative name, Bitcorn, for the project. This project is nothing without you.
